<P>anjiro and Nezuko make their way toward Mt. Sagiri when they encounter a demon residing in a nearby temple. They manage to successfully restrain it, but<BR>
     he finds himself hesitant to kill it, leaving it to burn in the sunlight. At this time, he meets Sakonji Urokodaki, who chastises him for his poor resolve<BR>
      and warns him about what will happen if Nezuko decides to kill a human. After letting Nezuko rest, Urokodaki puts Tanjiro through a test to prove his worthiness<BR>
         by climbing up and descending the hazardous and trap-infested Mt. Sagiri. Tanjiro succeeds in the task, and after recalling the letter from Giyu requesting<BR>
             him to train Tanjiro to become a Demon Slayer, Urokodaki accepts him as his student.</P>
